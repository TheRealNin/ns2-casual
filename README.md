## NS2 Casual

A collection of changes and mods for Natural Selection 2 with a goal of a more accessible game.

It has the following design goals:

- A player should be able to play at an acceptable level without audio (either due to physical limitations or simply listening to music)
- Games should be playable with as few as 1 person on each team
- Important information should be easily accessed and only kept hidden for justifiable gameplay reasons (for example, cloaking)
- Balance values should be kept as close as possible to vanilla NS2



### Mod list

- Persistent Minimap Buildings
- Improved Gorge Spit

## Other Changes

- All friendly structures can be seen through walls at a reasonable distance
