## NS2 Casual

A collection of changes and mods for Natural Selection 2 with a goal of a more accessible game.

It has the following design goals:

- A player should be able to play at an acceptable level without audio (either due to physical limitations or simply listening to music)
- Games should be playable with as few as 1 person on each team
- Important information should be easily accessed and only kept hidden for justifiable gameplay reasons (for example, cloaking)
- Limit frustrations caused by teammates playing sub-optimally
- Balance values should be kept as close as possible to vanilla NS2



### Mod list

- Persistent Minimap Buildings
- - Once an enemy building is spotted, it will stay on the minimap after it goes out of sight. When not in sight, the building appears grey.
- - Commanders can see these buildings as ghostly models
